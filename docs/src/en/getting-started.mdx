# Getting Started

## Overview

Thanks to [`pressify`](https://github.com/codpoe/pressify) that could support `React docs+demos` well to run with `vite`.

Compare to other tools:

- [`dumi`](https://d.umijs.org/)
  - it is coupled with webpack instead.
- [`vuepress@next`](https://github.com/vuepress/vuepress-next) with `vite bundler`
  - it seems not good enough to support `React docs+demos`.
- [`vite-plugin-react-pages`](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-pages)
  - for early version, it seems not able to show both demos and source codes in the `CodeBlock`.

## Preview

Try [QR code playground](https://nikoni.top/rui-next/docs/components/qr-code/index.html) to scan to access the examples on mobile/tablet device.
