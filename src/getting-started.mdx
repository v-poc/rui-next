# Getting Started

## Overview

Thanks to [`rspress`](https://github.com/web-infra-dev/rspress) that could support `React docs+demos` well.

Compare to other tools:

- [`dumi`](https://d.umijs.org/)
  - it is coupled with `webpack` instead.
- [`vuepress@next`](https://github.com/vuepress/vuepress-next) with `vite bundler`
  - it seems not good enough to support `React docs+demos`.
- [`vite-plugin-react-pages`](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-pages)
  - for early version, it seems not able to show both demos and source codes in the `CodeBlock`.
- [`vitepress-rc`](https://github.com/cvnine/vitepress-rc) / [`pressify`](https://github.com/Codpoe/pressify) / [`vpressify`](https://github.com/v-poc/vpressify)
  - it lacks of regular maintenance.
